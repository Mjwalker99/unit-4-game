Crystals Collector Game

A guessing/memory game using numbers.

There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

There will be a random generated number at the start of the game.

When the player clicks on a crystal it will add an amount of points to the total score. 

You win the game if your total score is equal to the random number, and your Wins will go up by 1.

You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number, and your Losses will go up by 1.

The value of each crystal is invisible until you click it.

Once you win or lose, the game will reset and a new random number will be generated.
